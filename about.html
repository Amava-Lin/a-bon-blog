    <p>This is where you can talk about yourself. Tell people what you're about, what your blog is about, and where they can find you. Consider embedding a form for inquiries, adding Google Analytics to track site traffic, or just keep it simple. This world is your oyster.</p>

    <p>Huge thanks to ShakeyShane's <a href="https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync">starter project</a> that bundled BrowserSync, Gulp, SASS, and Jekyll into a sweet development package. This theme's reponsive styles are bulit using Flexbox. Font Awesome, jQuery, and a few Google Fonts come pre-configured.</p>
