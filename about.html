    <p>This theme is inspired by a ceratin cooking website/publication. It's resposive using flexbox and the project file users BrowserSync, Sass, Gulp, and (of course) Jekyll.</p>

    <p>This is where you can talk about yourself. Tell people where to find you. Link to things like <a href="#">this</a> or <a href="#">that</a>. Consider embedding a form for inquiries, or do whatever you want. I really don't care. This world is your oyster.</p>
