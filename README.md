# Overview
In addition to Jekyll, you'll need to have Gulp, BrowserSync and SASS installed. I used ShakeyShane's [jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync](https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync) project as a base for this theme during development.

Also, this theme uses [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) for the search function. Big thanks to them.
