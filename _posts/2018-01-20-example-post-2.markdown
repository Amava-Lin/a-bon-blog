## Overview (h2)

This is what a post looks like in this theme. There are callout boxes you can put at the top. This theme was inspired by a recipe site, but you can probably think of a way to incorporate these detail boxes into a variety of genres. If it isn't applicable to you, just hide it.

This theme comes prepped with stylings for H2s (above) and H3s (below). Feel free to tweak these styles or add additional header styles based on your needs.

### Typography (h3)

Here's a demo of typography stylings for this theme. There are stylings for `<h2>` and `<h3>`in addition to post titles. The first `<h2>` elements within a post will have a solid black border above it.

* Unordered lists are supported
* And they look like This
  - Here's an indented item

By default, the `post` layout includes a templated call out box for ingredients. If you don't plan on using ingredients, or don't have a use for a callout box, either revise the template, or create another post layout type.

1. An ordered list looks like this
2. Feel free to list out
3. Whatever your heart desires

All typography styles can be accessed within `/_sass/typography.sass`. You can update your font choice there too.

### How to Use and Dependencies (h3)

In addition to Jekyll, you'll need to have Gulp and SASS installed. I used ShakeyShane's [jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync](https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync) project as a base for this theme during development.

You can fork or download this theme from my repo [here](https://github.com/ninapetrop/a-bon-blog).
